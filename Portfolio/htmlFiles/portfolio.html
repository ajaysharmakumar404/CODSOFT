                <li>REDUCING TRAFFIC CONGESTION 
                    THROUGH REINFORCEMENT LEARNING 
                    TECHNIQUES IN SUMO under Mr. SATISH KUMAR NEGI</li> <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Description: By evaluating 
                        different parameters in a SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) generated 
                        dataset, our algorithm strives to attain optimal outcomes. Initially, we conducted 
                        a baseline simulation, followed by the implementation of Q-Learning, Deep        
                        Q-Learning, SARSA, and Bias Q-Learning algorithms. Subsequently, we 
                        compared the results derived from these algorithms. This research endeavor aims 
                        to enhance efficiency in bustling urban areas by significantly alleviating traffic 
                        congestion.</li><br>
                    <li>Technologies Used: Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) , Traffic Control Interfae (TraCI), Unity, PyTorch, Python, Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</li> <br>
                    <li>Outcome: Overall, the proposed model addresses the critical issue of urban traffic 
                        congestion. While it has made significant strides by implementing various 
                        reinforcement learning algorithms, the potential for improvement remains vast. 
                        Quantum computing emerges as a promising avenue to enhance accuracy and 
                        efficiency, potentially revolutionizing the training process. However, the project 
                        faces challenges such as access to real data, funding constraints, and 
                        environmental inconsistencies. Recommendations for future implementation 
                        include leveraging advancements in electronic and quantum computing, 
                        exploring hierarchical methods for optimization, incorporating simulations of 
                        road accidents, and integrating real-world data for more accurate analyses. 
                        Ultimately, the goal is to deploy the model in real traffic systems, supported by 
                        robust sensor capabilities, to alleviate urban congestion effectively. </li> <br>
